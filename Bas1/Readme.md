## Javascript
to print in cosolve we use console.log() in javascript.

## Data Types in Javascript
--> Primitive Data Types:
A. Numeric 
1. Number
2. BigInt
B. Non Numeric
1. String
2. Boolean
3. Undefined
4. Null

--> Non Primitive Data Types:
1. Object
2. Array
3. Function

## Everything is an Object in Javascript

## static or primitive data types are stored in stack memory
## non primitive or reference data types are stored in heap memory

## one reference is stored in stack memory which points to the actual object stored in heap memory

## c,c++,java are statically typed languages
## javascript is dynamically typed language

# functions in javascript
* java contains only methods as everhything is inside class
* javascript contains functions as well as methods
* c contains functions only
* c++ contains functions and methods both


# operators in javascript
 important is = == and = = =



# conditional statements and control statements in javascript are same as c,c++,java


## collections of Data

* Array --> 
    * ordered collection of data
    * indexed collection of data
    * we can store heterogeneous data in array in javascript but preferably we should store homogeneous data
    * index starts from 0 but why ? --> because its easier to calculate the offset from
      the base address. --> offset = index *  size of each element

* Object -->
    * unordered collection of data
    * key-value pair collection of data
    * we can store heterogeneous data in object
    * key should be unique and value can be duplicate
    * key is always string data type but value can be of any data type
    * each key value pair is called property of object.



- exceptions can be handled but errors cannot be handled.
